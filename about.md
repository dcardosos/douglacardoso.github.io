<h1> Hi, I'm Douglas &#128075;&#128104;&#8205;&#128187;</h1>

![douglas](profile_apresentation.png)

I'm a graduate student in business administration at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and I am passionate about programming, data science and machine learning. I made this blog with the intention of (i) documenting what I've been learning and (ii) training my English, so now I apologize for the mistakes.
